### Example:
![Demo](assets/example.png)

## Getting started
* You need an OpenAI API key saved in the ".env" file (OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-key-comes-here"). The .env file is git-ignored.
* Create environment in cmd terminal (if not done yet): `python -m venv venv`
* Activate environment (on Windows): `venv\Scripts\activate`
* To install all required packages run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
--> if access denied due to managed laptops from work enter: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
* (To save the current packages: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)
* Then run the command in cmd terminal `streamlit run app.py` (or `python -m streamlit run app.py`) to run the app on localhost. You can ask questions about the book "Memory" (What is the levels of processing framework?). The chatbot asks leading questions (Ã  la Socrates) to help you find the answer yourself.


## Models used
* OpenAI's `gpt-4`

# To Do
- [ ] user auth
- [ ] user history logging
- [ ] Streaming answers
- [ ] Add a retry loop that checks if GPT drifted from the Socratic tone or topic. --> not necessary, it already stays on topic.
